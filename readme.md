# Piscis Aquarium Website
This is a prototype of a simple website for Piscis Aquarium, created by Dion Osvaldo Hananto.

## Technology Stack: HTML and CSS
This project is built using HTML and CSS, which are fundamental technologies for web development.

### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTML is a markup language that structures the content on web pages. It uses tags to define different elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. HTML provides the backbone of web pages, allowing you to organize and present information effectively.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is a style sheet language that controls the presentation and layout of HTML elements. It enables you to define colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and other visual properties. By applying CSS rules to HTML elements, you can create visually appealing and consistent designs.

By combining HTML and CSS, we can create simple yet functional websites with structured content and appealing styles. HTML defines the content, while CSS enhances the presentation, resulting in an engaging user experience.

> **Note:** This website is a prototype and does not reflect a live, fully functional website. It serves as a demonstration of web development skills and the potential of a Piscis Aquarium online presence.
